    "desc": "TCP is a network communication protocol used by HTTP, SSH, FTP and a lot more network protocols. It consists to send supposedly error-free network packets in a specific order. First, the client asks the server to synchronize (SYN). Then, the server acknowledges the demand and synchronize with the client (SYN/ACK). Finally, the client acknowledges that the connection is synchronized and sends its data.",
